Readme - Cartoon Water Shaders
____________________________________


Shaders : 

  - Advanced Water + Double Sided 
The advanced water use the depth blend technique to automatically add edges effect around all geometries passing through the water.
This effect has a real impact on performance, so it's better using this shader on pc/console.

  - Simple Water(Mobile) + Double Sided
The Simple Water has been created as an alternative for mobile devices. This shader don't use depth blend to create the edges effects. 
To create the edge around an island for exemple, you will need to use the Foam Mobile shader applied to an other mesh (cf Mobile demo scene).

- Foam (Mobile)
Add this shader to a planar geometrie to simulate foam for mobile application (the mesh will need uv). 
Like in the Mobile demo scene using this shader in combination with Simple Water will save performance.  


We are working on a tool to create this kind of geometrie around a mesh right inside Unity. This tool will definitively improve the workflow to 
create foam geo for mobile applications.
